            Most people have a short, mid and long term goal, So do I. I've been
            asking myself for the past 9 months (since I started this career)
            this questions;
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>What do you want to know?</li>
            <li>What are you doing to Know them?</li>
            <li>How much do you want to know?</li>
            <li>What do you want to archieve with it?</li>
            <li>How Long is your duration</li>
          </ul>
          <blockquote>
            " You don't always get what you wish for, but you always get what
            you work for. I will fight. I will not give up. I will reach my goal
            and nothing can stop me."
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            I'll answer these questions putting 5 years into consideration
          </p>

          <h4>What do you want to know? ðŸ§ </h4>
          <p>
            &mdash; I want to know the anatomy of the computer and the internet
            and how it is connected to the Technologies that is used to alter
            and modify it.
          </p>
          <p>
            &mdash; I want to understand the computer' major languages
            (especially the web languages) to enable me put out exactly what I
            have in mind to reality without improvising, do to incompetence.
          </p>
          <p>
            &mdash; I want to know those things I don't know they exist in this
            career, it is obvious that they're a lot and I'm ready to embrace as
            much as my brain's arm can stretch.
          </p>
          <p>
            &mdash; I want to (research ongoing) understand peoples emotional
            intelegence cos it will help a lot when working in a team with
            different people from different background as well as different
            emotions (it' key).
          </p>

          <h4>What are you doing to Know them? ðŸ“š</h4>

          <p>
            &mdash; I have my PC which I always make sure a punch the keyboard
            after learning new stuffs to solidify it. I also have projects that
            I've worked and I am working on.
          </p>
          <p>
            &mdash; I have couple of ebooks on my system and mobile phone for
            understanding concepts and fundamentals.
          </p>
          <p>
            &mdash; I've subscribe to some tech YT channels to learn new stuffs
            via tutorials.
          </p>
          <p>
            &mdash; I've enroll on some free courses online.
          </p>
          <p>
            &mdash; I've online mentors that are always my 'go to' when am
            hooked on something (I appreciate y'all ).
          </p>

          <h4>How much do you want to know? ðŸ¤”</h4>
          <p>I want to know as much as my brain can take</p>

          <h4>What do you want to archieve with it?</h4>
          <p>This is the biggest motivation.</p>
          <p>
            It may not be another social media cos we have a hand full of that
            already.
          </p>
          <p>I want to be the best I can be to;</p>
          <p>
            &mdash; Help 'start up' business owners, Schools, Organizations and
            NGOs build a reputable and noticeable online presence
          </p>
          <p>&mdash; Contribute to Open source projects online</p>
          <p>
            &mdash; Upgrade Nigeria and Africa in tech as much as my strenth and
            ability can permit
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              ><em>
                As I continue to learn, more things to archieve will reveal
                itself.</em
              ></strong
            >
          </p>
          <h4>How Long is your duration âŒ›</h4>
          <p>
            Five years from now
            <strong>But I'm aiming way less than that.</strong>
